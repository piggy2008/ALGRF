# ALGRF
This is the code for the paper "Video Salient Object Detection via Adaptive Local-Global Refinement"

# Usage
1. config.py. It is for dataset path. You can configure your image path in this file.
2. infer.py. It is for testing. After configuring the image path, you can use it to generate saliency maps.
3. pretrained. The pretrained model can save here. And, the saliency results also can save here. The pretrained model link is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g0-xaoU_FOUVNFQEumEkCEhQhZdoufzN/view?usp=sharing
